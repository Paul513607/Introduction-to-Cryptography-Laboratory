 The Homework from the Introduction to Cryptography Laboratory. <br />

# Homework 1
Implementation of Vigenere and Substitution Cryptosystems encipher and decipher (with the stantard English language frequencies for letters), using letter, bigram and trigram frequency analysis and index of coincidence & mutual index of coincidence (for the Vigenere Cryptosystem, for finding the key length & key). <br />

# Homework 2
Implementation of two pseudo random number generators, Blum-Blum-Shub Generator (using parity of seed^2 modulo N as bit generation) and Jacobi Generator (using the Jacobi Symbol of the seeds and N as bit generation). (N (represented on 1024 bits) is a product of two big primes, represented on 512 bits each) <br />
We also conducted two tests for each generator, a frequency test on the amount of 0s and 1s in the bitstring and a compression test, comparing the compression of generated bitstring with the compression of a repeating pattern (like '010101...'). <br />
